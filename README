This is the code to run the simulations for Hrystenko et al. 2022

MOST OF THE THIS CODE IS COPIED (and revised) FROM https://github.com/YanaHrytsenko/determining_population_structure_from_k-mer_frequencies

Run each item in 0_fix_ref.sh if needed (just once) to get a good starting sequence (or just use the provided segments of the human genome or random starting sequence)

Check out the .slim files

Run slim (did this on my Mac locally not a cluster)
