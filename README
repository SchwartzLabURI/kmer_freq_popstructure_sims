This is the code to run the simulations for Hrystenko et al. 2022

MOST OF THE THIS CODE IS COPIED (and revised) FROM https://github.com/YanaHrytsenko/determining_population_structure_from_k-mer_frequencies

Open the .slim file in the SlimGUI and run it (did this on my Mac locally not a cluster)
Copy the output to a .fa file and delete the header text

Open 1_jellyfish.sh - edit this file where it says change and run
Repeat for 2_ and 3_ sh files
